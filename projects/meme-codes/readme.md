# Project: Meme Codes

Most of us have encountered some form of coded message in our technological travels though life and have had no idea what the message meant.
Codes like `200`, `503`, `PC LOAD LETTER`, and `IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL` have a meaning that is understood by those in the know, but not to those of us who may be unfamiliar. In this project you will be documenting a group of codes using images. HTTP codes are a popular group of codes to cover for this project, but other groups of codes may provide more breadth of knowledge and interesting opportunities for creativity.

## Goals

- Use a variety of images and maybe some text to describe an assortment of codes for others.
- Try your best to respect licensing and copyright.
- Share your documentation of codes with others.

## Examples

- [HTTP Birb Codes](http://birb.codes/)
- [HTTP STATUS DOGS](https://httpstatusdogs.com/)
- [HTTP Status Cats API](https://http.cat/)

## Ideas for Creativity

- Create your own art/assets if you have enough time to do so.
- Consider using an alternative to images such as ANSI art.
- Do something other than HTTP response codes such as [errno](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/errno.3.html) or printer errors.

## Potential Learning

The first thing you should learn from this project is an understanding of the topic you are documenting. For example, if you document [HTTP response codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status), you will have to learn what some of the response codes mean.

Additionally you can expect to learn more about and get experience with the following:

- [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and maybe even some [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Static Site Generators](https://www.staticgen.com/) - Practice [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). Note that the most popular tools may not be the best fit for this project.
- Web Hosting - Hosting the content you create online so you can share it with others.
- DNS - If you desire a domain name and don't mind spending a bit of money.
- Licensing and [Copyright](https://www.teachingcopyright.org/) - Be respectful and follow the law/rules when using somebody's content.
